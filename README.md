Piezo Piano Project

## WhatÂ´s this?
PiezoPiano is a PCB piano which can play one octave - all at once.

## Implementation
The processor generates a square wave for every note which is played. This is realised via timers and a interrupt.

```c
#define C4 84                   // Each note gets a different frequency
unsigned char notes[8] = {0};   // Array for individual counting of notes
```
In the section above the global variable 'notes' is initialized.
```c
notes[1]++;                     // This array contains eight 

// Generate Note 1
if(!(PINB & BTN1) && (notes[1] >= C4))
{
  setBit(PIND, NTE1);           // Toggle Pin for 50 % Duty Cycle (PIND and NTE1 are just defines for a PORT and a PIN)
  notes[1] = 0;                 // Reset Counter
}
```
This code snippet gives an insight how the waveform is generated. The algorithm is extended for all eight channels.

## Build of Material - BOM
TBD as there is a refactoring in the making.
